# Architecture Design & UI Standards

Last updated: 2026-01-07

This folder contains documentation for **design decisions, UI standards, and architectural design patterns**. This complements the technical architecture documentation in [`docs/architecture/`](../architecture/).

## 📋 Purpose

**`docs/architecture-design/`** focuses on **design decisions and UI standards**:
- Domain-driven design guidelines and patterns
- UI design principles and component standards
- Dashboard UI standards and conventions
- Design system architecture

**`docs/architecture/`** focuses on **technical architecture**:
- System architecture and runtime boundaries
- Codebase structure and organization
- Technical patterns (actions vs API routes, barrels, etc.)
- Implementation details and technical decisions

## 📚 Design Documentation

### Domain-Driven Design
- [Domain-Driven Architecture Guidelines](domain-driven-architecture.md) - DDD patterns, domain organization, and growth management

### UI Design Standards
- [UI Design Guide](ui-design-guide.md) - Design system principles, component patterns, and styling guidelines
- [Dashboard UI Standards](dashboard-ui-standards.md) - Dashboard-specific UI conventions and patterns

## 🔗 Related Documentation

- [Architecture Overview](../architecture/architecture-overview.md) - High-level system architecture
- [Codebase Structure](../architecture/codebase-structure.md) - Directory layout and module organization
- [Runtime Boundaries](../architecture/runtime-boundaries.md) - Edge vs Node.js runtime considerations
