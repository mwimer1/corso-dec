# Architecture Decisions

This directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs) and design choices that document important technical decisions made during the development of the Corso platform.

## Purpose

These documents capture the rationale behind architectural choices, alternatives considered, and the context in which decisions were made. They serve as a historical record and help future developers understand why certain patterns or approaches were chosen.

## Contents

- [Route Theme Duplication](./route-theme-duplication.md) - Decision on handling route-specific theme providers

## Adding New Decisions

When making a significant architectural decision:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Follow the ADR format:
   - Context: What is the issue we're addressing?
   - Decision: What is the decision we're making?
   - Consequences: What are the implications?
3. Link to this README from relevant documentation
4. Update this README's contents list
