# API Types

Type definitions for API contracts, generated from the OpenAPI specification.

## Generated Types

### `types/api/generated/openapi.d.ts`

**⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT**

This file is automatically generated from `api/openapi.yml` and should never be edited manually. All changes must be made to the OpenAPI specification file.

**Location:** Generated types are stored in `types/api/generated/` to clearly distinguish them from hand-authored types.

**Regeneration:**
```bash
pnpm openapi:gen
```

This command:
1. Bundles the OpenAPI spec (`pnpm openapi:bundle`)
2. Lints the spec (`pnpm openapi:lint`)
3. Generates TypeScript types (`pnpm openapi:types`)

**Automatic Regeneration:**
The file is automatically regenerated during `pnpm typecheck` via the `pretypecheck` hook.

## Import Patterns

**Prefer the barrel import** for OpenAPI types:

```typescript
// ✅ Preferred: Barrel import for OpenAPI types
import type { operations, paths, components } from '@/types/api';
```

The `types/api/index.ts` barrel is maintained specifically for OpenAPI types to provide a stable import path.

## OpenAPI Specification

The source OpenAPI specification is located at:
- `api/openapi.yml` - Human-readable YAML specification
- `api/openapi.json` - Bundled JSON (generated)
