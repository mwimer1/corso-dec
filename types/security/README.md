# Security Types

Type definitions for security policies, rules, and related security features.

## Import Patterns

**Note:** Security policy types have been removed as they were unused in the codebase. Security configuration is handled via runtime code in `lib/security/` rather than type definitions.

If security policy types are needed in the future, they should be defined based on actual implementation requirements.

## Note on Prompt Guard Types

Prompt guard types were previously located here but have been removed as dead code. If you need prompt guard functionality, check the security implementation in `lib/security/`.
