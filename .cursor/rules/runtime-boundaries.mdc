# Runtime Boundaries & Server/Edge Imports

**Enforce strict runtime boundaries between Edge and Node.js to prevent runtime errors and maintain bundle safety.**

## TL;DR
- **Route runtime**: Route files MUST declare `export const runtime = 'edge' | 'nodejs'`
- **Server imports**: Client/shared code cannot import from `@/lib/server/**` (AST-grep enforced)
- **Edge safety**: `@/lib/api` barrel must remain Edge-compatible at all times
- **Client safety**: `@/lib/shared` barrel must remain client-compatible at all times
- **Server-only**: Use `index.server.ts` barrels for server-only exports
- **Environment**: Only `@/lib/server/env` for server env access

## Server vs Client boundaries (final)

- Do **not** re-export server-only modules from client/shared barrels. Use a dedicated `index.server.ts` barrel for server-only exports.
- Route files MUST declare `export const runtime = 'edge' | 'nodejs'`.
- If any import from `@/lib/server/**` exists, use `'nodejs'` and ensure `import 'server-only'` exists in those modules.
- `@/lib/server/env` is the only allowed entry for server env. Never import `lib/shared/env/*`.
- Client/shared code cannot import from `@/lib/server/**`. AST-grep rules enforce this; do not suppress.

## @/lib/api Edge Safety (Critical)
The `@/lib/api` barrel **must remain Edge-compatible** at all times. This is a critical project convention:
- ✅ Only export Edge-safe utilities (http helpers, redirect helpers, validation)
- ❌ Never re-export Node-only utilities (ClickHouse, server-side streaming, rate limiting)
- ✅ Use subpath imports for Node-only code: `@/lib/server/streaming/ndjson` instead of `@/lib/server`
- ✅ Import server utilities directly in Node routes to maintain Edge compatibility

**Violation Impact**: Breaking `@/lib/api` Edge safety will cause all Edge routes to fail at runtime.

## @/lib/shared Client Safety (Critical)
The `@/lib/shared` barrel **must remain client-compatible** at all times. This is a critical project convention:
- ✅ Only export client-safe utilities (validation schemas, config helpers, assets)
- ❌ Never re-export server-only utilities (environment validation, domain configs, feature flags)
- ✅ Use `@/lib/shared/config/client` for client components and `@/lib/server/shared/server` for server-only code
- ✅ Import server utilities directly in server routes to maintain client compatibility

**Violation Impact**: Breaking `@/lib/shared` client safety will cause all client components to fail at runtime.

## Notes
- Keep undefined ClickHouse options elided to satisfy `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
- Prefer explicit subpath imports (e.g., `@/lib/server/streaming/ndjson`) over broad server barrels in shared modules.

### Clerk + App Router (Protected Pages)

- All protected app routes stay on Node runtime: `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`.
- Do not import `@/lib/server/**` from client components (e.g., dashboard sidebar). Use server-only logic only in route files or server modules.
- Use `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` exclusively in server contexts (layouts/pages/api handlers), never in client components.

### Next.js 15 route props (PageProps.params)

- Generated `.next/types/**` uses `params?: Promise<...>`. Accept `{ params: Promise<T> }` and `await params` in route components and `generateMetadata`.
- Health endpoint exception: `/api/status/health` is allowed to run on Edge and must avoid importing any Node-only utilities. No app-level rate limiting applies.

## Enforcement
- **ast-grep rules**: `scripts/rules/ast-grep/consolidated-no-direct-clickhouse-import-outside-integration.yml` (run with `ast-grep run`)
- **CI validation**: `pnpm validate:runtime-boundaries` (automated in CI pipeline)
- **Manual check**: `ast-grep run --pattern "import.*@clickhouse" --lang typescript app/`
