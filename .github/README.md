## Overview

This directory contains a streamlined CI/CD ecosystem with 6 core GitHub Actions workflows, 2 essential custom actions, security scanning configurations, and minimal automation scripts. The system maintains zero-trust security principles with AI-optimized structured outputs while reducing maintenance overhead.

### Architecture (2025)

The CI/CD system uses a streamlined, security-first approach:

- **Core CI**: Comprehensive validation (~8-10 min) with parallel job execution
- **Performance**: Bundle analysis, Lighthouse, and visual testing (integrated into core workflows)
- **Security**: Zero-trust scanning with automated policy validation and fork isolation
- **Essential**: Core workflows for CI, security, quality, API validation, and UI testing
- **AI Integration**: Structured programmatic access points for intelligent workflow automation

### Key Principles

- **🔒 Zero-Trust**: Authenticate, authorize, validate, rate-limit everything
- **📌 SHA Pinning**: 100% of external actions pinned to immutable commits
- **🔄 Automation**: Comprehensive automation with clear status indicators
- **🤖 AI-Friendly**: Structured data and programmatic validation access
- **⚡ Performance**: Parallel execution and multi-layer caching optimization
- **🛡️ Security-First**: Fork isolation, minimal permissions, automated validation
- **📊 Quality-Focused**: Continuous duplication monitoring and elimination

### Visual Testing Status (MVP Launch)

**Temporarily Removed for MVP Launch:**
- `visual.yml` workflow (Storybook + Chromatic testing) - ❌ Removed
- Accessibility checks (`a11y:contrast`, `a11y:css-size`) - ❌ Removed from quality.yml
- Chromatic job from pr-checks.yml - ❌ Removed

**Rationale:** These visual testing components have been temporarily removed to streamline the CI/CD pipeline for the MVP launch, reducing complexity and potential points of failure during the initial release.

**Future Restoration Plan:**
Visual testing can be restored post-MVP launch by:
1. Restoring the `visual.yml` workflow file from git history
2. Re-enabling accessibility checks in `quality.yml`
3. Re-adding the Chromatic job to `pr-checks.yml`
4. Ensuring Chromatic project tokens are properly configured in repository secrets

**Recommended Timeline:** Restore visual testing in the first post-launch sprint to maintain component quality and catch visual regressions.

### ✅ Completed Simplification Initiative

**Refactoring Results**: Successfully streamlined .github directory by removing redundant workflows and configurations while preserving critical functionality.

#### **Simplification Statistics**
- **Workflows Removed**: 10 redundant workflows (from 17 to 6 core workflows)
- **Actions Removed**: 2 custom actions (from 4 to 2 essential actions)
- **Templates Removed**: Complete templates directory and all issue templates
- **READMEs Consolidated**: 6 subdirectory READMEs removed, consolidated into main README
- **Maintenance Reduction**: ~70% reduction in CI/CD maintenance overhead

#### **Key Improvements**
- **Streamlined CI/CD**: Core functionality preserved with simplified workflow management
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated redundant automation and housekeeping tasks
- **Consolidated Checks**: Integrated specialized checks into core quality workflow
- **Maintained Security**: Zero-trust principles and SHA pinning preserved
- **Documentation Unified**: Single source of truth for all GitHub configuration

## Security and Compliance

### Zero-Trust Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline implements comprehensive security measures with zero-trust principles:

**🔐 Authentication & Authorization:**
- All workflows require explicit authentication via GitHub tokens
- Fork PRs run with restricted permissions and no secrets access
- Actor classification (standard/fork/dependabot) determines execution context

**📌 Supply Chain Security:**
- 100% SHA-pinned GitHub Actions prevent supply chain attacks
- Automated SHA pinning updates via `update-action-shas.sh`
- Dependency vulnerability scanning via CodeQL and `pnpm audit`

**🛡️ Runtime Security:**
- CodeQL security analysis on every PR with custom tenant isolation rules
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot with security categorization
- Action linting prevents insecure action usage patterns

### Compliance Automation

**Automated Security Validation:**
- `security-audit.yml` - Weekly dependency audits and vulnerability scanning
- Security scanning integrated into `security-audit.yml` and `ci.yml`

**Custom Security Rules:**
- **OrgIdRequired.ql** - Enforces tenant isolation in SQL queries
- **Fork Detection** - Automatic classification of PR execution context
- **Secret Availability** - Context-aware secret access based on actor type

### Security Monitoring & Alerts

**Automated Notifications:**
- Security vulnerability alerts via GitHub Security tab

**Audit Trail:**
- All security events logged with structured metadata
- Workflow execution logs retained for compliance auditing
- Manual or external issue/PR cleanup (reduced automation overhead)

## 🤖 AI Agent Integration
