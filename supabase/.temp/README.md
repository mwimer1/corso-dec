# Supabase CLI Version Tracking

## Why this directory is versioned

The `cli-latest` file tracks the latest Supabase CLI version used in this project. This is versioned to ensure consistency across development environments and CI/CD pipelines.

## Files

- `cli-latest` - Contains the version string of the latest Supabase CLI (e.g., `v2.40.7`)

## Maintenance
